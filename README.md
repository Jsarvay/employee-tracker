## Installation

perform a git clone from github to copy files to your local drive. From there, perform an 'npm i' in order to get all necessary dependencies. Finally, run the schema.sql code in mysql workbench in order to create the databases.
    
## Usage
<a name="usage"></a>
Once installation is complete, you may run 'node index' in order to start the series of inquirer prompts. Add department, role, and employee will add the applicable information to its respective table. View will allow you to read through the databases based on how you would like to see it broken down. Update employee will allow the user to update the employee's role to another position.
